        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Parichad Wiangsong, and I am a passionate Digital Media Engineering student with a strong foundation in 3D animation and
modeling. Experience managing projects and collaborating with teams using industry tools like Blender
and Jira.
        </p>

        <p>
          I chose Digital Media Engineering because I love the combination of
          art and software development. Iâ€™m interested in optimizing animation pipelines for both artistic quality and technical efficiency and eager to contribute my skills for a dynamic team as an 3D Animator, where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue to grow professionally.
        </p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Here are some of the key projects I've worked on during my studies:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Mangon Nam Jeen Eiei, 3D Modeling Development</strong><br />
            Sculpted a detailed 3D model of a Chinese water dragon, focusing on both anatomical accuracy
            and artistic expression. Utilized precision and problem-solving to create intricate details in the sculpt, ensuring both
            technical and aesthetic quality. Used Blender for high-detail sculpting, mesh detailing, and rendering, while collaborating with peers
            to refine the model.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Aero to Aqua, 3D Animation Short Film</strong><br />
            Independently developed and directed a 200-frame animation titled Aero to Aqua, with a focus on
            the theme of Transformation. Used Blender to create smooth transitions and detailed character movements, showcasing problem-
            solving throughout the animation process. Applied principles of animation to ensure a cohesive final product, combining creativity with
            technical knowledge of movement and timing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sugar Sugar Rune, 3D Modeling Development</strong><br />
            Designed and created a detailed 3D model for a course project titled Sugar Sugar Rune. The project centered around the theme of Fantasy. Used Blender for modeling, texturing, and rendering.
            </li>
        </ol>

          <h3>Kapoo production: Pratical Traning 2567/3</h3>
          <p>
            <time datetime="2025-04-01">April</time> - <time datetime="2025-06-30">June 2025</time>
            </p>
          <p>
            During the internship at Kapoo Production (The Duck Gen Co., Ltd.), I held the position of a 3D Animator Intern. My main responsibilities encompassed creating and revising 3D animation assets, cleaning up motion capture data, developing 3D models for use in event-related projects, and collaborating closely with the animation and production teams. Key tasks included animating character models, designing assets for a live gacha event, and producing VTuber-style speed ramp animation clips.
          </p>
          <p>
            This internship allowed me to build a strong foundation in 3D animation production, including technical skills in Blender and Unity, and hands-on experience with the animation pipeline typical in digital content and event productions. I also developed soft skills such as time management, teamwork, and adapting to fast-paced, real-world production environments. Regular feedback and collaborative assignments deepened my understanding of both the art and technical requirements of industry-level animation work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The internship was highly suitable for computer engineering students with an interest in computer graphics, animation, and creative technology. It provided a practical blend of software development, algorithmic problem solving (especially in handling animation curves and motion data), and multidisciplinary teamwork. All of which are valuable competencies in the modern field of computer engineering. The real-world exposure to production workflows, team collaboration, and industry-standard tools makes this internship highly recommended for future cohorts seeking a career at the intersection of technology and digital media.
